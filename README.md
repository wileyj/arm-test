# rusty-blockparser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gcarq/rusty-blockparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gcarq/rusty-blockparser) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gcarq/rusty-blockparser/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/gcarq/rusty-blockparser?branch=master) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rusty-blockparser.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-blockparser/)

rusty-blockparser is a Bitcoin Blockchain Parser written in **Rust language**.

It allows extraction of various data types (blocks, transactions, scripts, public keys/hashes, balances, ...) and UTXDO dumps from Bitcoin based blockchains.

##### **Currently Supported Blockchains:**

 `Bitcoin`, `Namecoin`, `Litecoin`, `Dogecoin`, `Myriadcoin` and `Unobtanium`.

It assumes a local copy of the blockchain with intact block index, downloaded with [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) 0.15.1+. If you are not sure whether your local copy is valid you can apply `--verify` to validate the chain and block merkle trees. If something doesn't match the parser exits.

## Features

* **Callbacks**

    Callbacks are built on top of the core parser. They can be implemented to extract specific types of information.

    `balances`: dumps all addresses with a non-zero balance.
    The csv file is in the following format:
    ```
    balances.csv
    address ; balance
    ```

    `unspentcsvdump`: dumps all UTXOs along with the address balance.
    The csv file is in the following format:
    ```
    unspent.csv
    txid ; indexOut ; height ; value ; address
    ```
    NOTE: The total size of the csv dump is at least 8 GiB (height 635000).


    `csvdump`: dumps all parsed data as CSV files into the specified `folder`. See [Usage](#Usage) for an example. I chose CSV dumps instead of  an active db-connection because `LOAD DATA INFILE` is the most performant way for bulk inserts.
    The files are in the following format:
    ```
    blocks.csv
    block_hash ; height ; version ; blocksize ; hashPrev ; hashMerkleRoot ; nTime ; nBits ; nNonce
    ```
    ```
    transactions.csv
    txid ; hashBlock ; version ; lockTime
    ```
    ```
    tx_in.csv
    txid ; hashPrevOut ; indexPrevOut ; scriptSig ; sequence
    ```
    ```
    tx_out.csv
    txid ; indexOut ; height ; value ; scriptPubKey ; address
    ```
    If you want to insert the files into MySql see [sql/schema.sql](sql/schema.sql).
    It contains all table structures and SQL statements for bulk inserting. Also see [sql/views.sql](sql/views.sql) for some query examples.
    NOTE: The total size of the csv dump is at least to 731 GiB (height 635000).


    `simplestats`: prints some blockchain statistics like block count, transaction count, avg transactions per block, largest transaction, transaction types etc.

You can also define custom callbacks. A callback gets called at startup, on each block and at the end. See [src/callbacks/mod.rs](src/callbacks/mod.rs) for more information.

* **Low memory usage**

    The required memory usage depends on the used callback:

        * simplestats: ~100MB
        * csvdump: ~100M
        * unspentcsvdump: ~18GB
        * balances: ~18GB

    NOTE: Those values are taken from parsing to block height 639631 (17.07.2020).

* **Script evaluation**

    Evaluates and detects P2PK, [P2PKH](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Pay-to-PubkeyHash), [P2SH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki) and some non-standard transactions.

* **Resume scans**

    `--start <height>` and `--end <height>` can be passed to resume a scan. However this makes no sense for `unspentcsvdump`!

## Installing

This tool runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.
All you need is `rust` and `cargo`.


### Latest Release

You can download the latest release from crates.io:
```bash
cargo install rusty-blockparser
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcarq/rusty-blockparser.git
cd rusty-blockparser
cargo build --release
cargo test --release
./target/release/rusty-blockparser --help
```

It is important to build with `--release`, otherwise you will get a horrible performance!

*Tested on Gentoo Linux with rust-stable 1.44.1

### Example

To make a `unspentcsvdump` of the Bitcoin blockchain your command would look like this:
```
